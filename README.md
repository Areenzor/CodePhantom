## **Key Features**  
- **Static Code Analysis**: Uncover vulnerabilities in source code.  
- **Dynamic Analysis**: Monitor application behavior at runtime.  
- **Fuzz Testing**: Identify edge-case vulnerabilities.  
- **RESTful API and CLI**: Easy integration into CI/CD pipelines.  
- **Web-Based Interface**: Visualize analysis reports and trends.
